# Database Skills Showcase  

This repository is a **collection of SQL, PL/SQL, LINQ, and NoSQL exercises** that demonstrate my ability to design databases, write complex queries, and work across both relational and non-relational systems.  

It is not a single cohesive project but rather a **skills portfolio**, covering everything from schema design and data insertion to advanced queries, stored procedures, triggers, and NoSQL operations.

## 📊 Highlights (Most Advanced Work)  

- **Recursive & Aggregated Queries** → Find faculty supervising the maximum students, handle ties, aggregate student names into one row.  
- **PL/SQL Triggers & Procedures** → Automated checks (e.g., prevent duplicate enrollments), salary-based faculty insertion procedure, reusable cursors.  
- **NoSQL MapReduce & Aggregation Pipelines** → Calculate averages (e.g., dragon weights by gender), showcase proficiency with MongoDB’s two querying approaches.

## 🗄️ Relational (Oracle SQL & PL/SQL)  

- **Database.sql** → Full schema for a university-style database (tables, constraints, insert statements).  
- **Analytical_SQL_Queries.sql** → Advanced queries such as:  
  - Students with highest total credits  
  - Supervisors with maximum students  
  - Courses offered multiple days a week  
  - Building capacity analysis  
- **PLSQL_Procedures_And_Triggers.sql** → Includes:  
  - **Triggers** for enforcing business rules  
  - **Stored procedures** with input parameters  
  - **Cursors & functions** for reusable logic  
- **LINQ.linq** → Querying relational DB with C#/LINQ, e.g.:  
  - Filter faculty by salary  
  - Join student/faculty tables  
  - Group students by supervisor  

---

## 📊 NoSQL (MongoDB)  

- **NoSQL_Dataset.txt** → Sample unstructured data (dragons 🐉).  
- **NoSQL_Queries.txt** → Examples include:  
  - `mapReduce` functions to group & average values  
  - Aggregation pipelines for filtering and summarizing

## 🔍 Why This Repo?  

This collection showcases my **breadth of database knowledge** across different paradigms and tools.  

Together, these exercises demonstrate my ability to:  
- Design and populate relational databases  
- Query using SQL, PL/SQL, and LINQ  
- Work with NoSQL systems using both classic and modern querying styles
