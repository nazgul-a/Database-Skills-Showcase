# ðŸ“Š SQL & NoSQL Database Portfolio  

This repository showcases a variety of **SQL, PL/SQL, LINQ, and NoSQL exercises** that demonstrate database design, querying, and data manipulation skills.  

The work includes:  
- Relational schema creation with constraints  
- Analytical SQL queries with joins, aggregations, and subqueries  
- PL/SQL triggers and stored procedures  
- LINQ queries for relational data access  
- NoSQL collections and queries  

âœ¨ While these scripts come from individual coursework exercises (not a single cohesive app), they collectively highlight a broad set of **database engineering skills**.
